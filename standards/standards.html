  <ol>
    <li>If artifacts are captured using Microsoft Word, then
      <ul>
        <li>the required font is Comic Sans MS.</li>
        <li>all titles must be generated using WordArt, with at least a two-color gradient and 3d or shadow effects.</li>
      </ul>
    <li>All requirements must be of tweetable length.</li>

  <h2>Test Document Standards</h2>
  <p>
    The tests in the test document shall be in a table
    To avoid the overhead of writing out class names for each element, the table is instead constructed with an implicit schema based on the number of the column content is placed in. This implicit schema is then denoted in the table tag. The current schema is denoted with class="test-table-schema-1".
  </p><p>
  "test-table-schema-1" is organised in the following way.
  The table shall have five columns, in the following order: step number, directions, test, passed/failed, and related requirements.
  The step number column shall contain a unique identifier for the test step.
  Related steps shall be grouped together using whole numbers seperated by a decimal. Thus step 1.11 comes <em>after</em> step 1.1.
  The directions shall be sentences which describe the necessary procedures to execute before the test column is evaluated.
  The passed/failed column is currently unused but may contain content in the future.
  The related requirements column should hyperlink to the requirements that the test step satisfies.
