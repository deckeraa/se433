  <h1>Standards</h1>
  <h2>Requirement Standards</h2>
  <p>
  The requirements document will be in a list.  The list will have sections to keep related requirements together.<br/>
  Each requirement shall have a label that can be linked to from other documents (e.g. the test document).<br/>
  Each requirement shall start with "The &lt;item&gt; shall", (e.g. "The system shall").<br/>
  If a requirement is related to any other requirements, a note with links to those requirements needs to be placed at the end of that requirement.<br/>
  Each requirement shall be small and concise to reduce complexity.
  <br/>
  See an example below:
  </p>
  <p>
  <h3><a name="Reqs">Requirements</a></h3>
  <h4><a name="GenReqs">General Requirements</a></h4>
  <a name="R1.0">R1.0 - The system shall be able to create a slice of toast, supposedly from a piece of bread.</a><br/>
  <a name="R1.9">R1.9 - The system shall heat a slice of bread to a such a significant degree that becomes toasted.</a><br/>
  <a name="R2.0">R2.0 - The system shall be able to create slices of toast that are consumable by humans.</a><br/>
  <a name="R3.0">R3.0 - The system shall use coils to heat the bread to create toast.</a><br/>
  <a name="R3.8">R3.8 - The system shall be able to heat each coil between 150 and 200 degrees Fahrenheit.</a><br/>
  <h4><a name="IOReqs">Input/Output Requirements</a></h4>
  <a name="IO1.0">IO1.0 - The system shall be able to consume a slice of bread as input.</a><br/>
  <a name="IO2.0">IO2.0 - The system shall be able to produce a slice of toast as output, given that a piece of bread has been given as input.  (See <a href="#IO1.0">IO1.0</a>)</a><br/>
  <a name="IO3.0">IO3.0 - The system shall have a main power switch that turns the toaster on.</a><br/>
  <a name="IO4.0">IO4.0 - The system shall have an activation lever on its anterior side, which when pressed will cause the system to consume a piece of bread if in the input slot.  (See <a href="#IO1.0">IO1.0</a>)</a><br/>
  <h4><a name="SafeReqs">Safety Requirements</a></h4>
  <a name="S1.0">S1.0 - The system shall be completely unsafe, considering the heat generated from the coils.  (See <a href="#R3.0">R3.0</a> and <a href="#R3.8">R3.8</a>)</a><br/>
  </p>
  <br/>
  <h2>Test Document Standards</h2>
  <p>
    The tests in the test document shall be in a table
    To avoid the overhead of writing out class names for each element, the table is instead constructed with an implicit schema based on the number of the column content is placed in. This implicit schema is then denoted in the table tag. The current schema is denoted with class="test-table-schema-1".
  </p><p>
  "test-table-schema-1" is organised in the following way.
  The table shall have five columns, in the following order: step number, directions, test, passed/failed, and related requirements.
  The step number column shall contain a unique identifier for the test step.
  Related steps shall be grouped together using whole numbers seperated by a decimal. Thus step 1.11 comes <em>after</em> step 1.1.
  The directions shall be sentences which describe the necessary procedures to execute before the test column is evaluated.
  The passed/failed column is currently unused but may contain content in the future.
  The related requirements column should hyperlink to the requirements that the test step satisfies.
  </p>

    <tr><td>Step #</td><td>Directions</td><td>Test</td><td>Passed/Failed</td><td>Related Req's</td></tr>

    <tr><td>2.2</td><td>Wait 20 seconds, then use an infrared thermometer to check to temperature of each coil.</td><td>Is each coil between 150 and 200 degrees Fahrenheit, inclusive?</td><td><input type="checkbox">Passed</input> </td><td><a href="#R3.8">R3.8</a></tr>
    <tr><td>3.0</td><td>Once toasting is complete, remove from device and consume each slice.</td><td>Do all of the slices taste good?</td><td><input type="checkbox">Passed</input> </td><td><a href="#R2.0">R2.0</a></tr>

  <h2>C</h2>
  <h3>Indentation</h3>
  <p>
    Indentation shall be 3 spaces.  All code blocks should be indented, as well as single line conditional bodies.
    Curly braces shall be indented to the same level as the statement, conditional, or function header which precedes them.
    Preprocessor macros shall always be aligned to the first column.
    Multiline statements should be indented at least 6 spaces more than the first line.
  </p>
  <h3>Newlines</h3>
  <p>
    All semicolons and curly braces shall be followed by a newline, except in for loop conditions.
    Single statement conditional bodies may be on the same line as the conditional
    An additional 1-4 newlines may be used between statements to establish logical separation.
    Function headers must be on the line after the end of the corresponding comment block.
  </p>
  <h3>Comments</h3>
  <p>
    Multiline comments should use /**/ style comments, single line comments may use either // (if using C99) or /**/.
    Every function should have a comment explaining what it does, and every struct should have a comment with a short description of it.
    Every include should have a short justification for inclusion before it.
    Comments do not need to use complete sentences but should be readable.
  </p>
  <h3>Naming</h3>
  <p>
    All variables, structs, defines, typedefs, and files shall have sane names.  Typedefs shall be suffixed with _t, including typedefed structs.  Functions, types, and variables which belong to a specific module shall be prefixed by the abbreviated module name followed by an underscore.  CamelCase shall be used for functions, and underscores shall be used between words for public variables.  Public functions and variables shall begin with a capital letter, and private variables and functions shall begin with a lower case variable.  Private functions and variables should only appear in header files when part of a public struct.
