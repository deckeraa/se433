  <h1>Standards</h1>
  <!-- <marquee>SE 4330 Project Standards Document</marquee> -->
  <ol>
    <li>If artifacts are captured using Microsoft Word, then
      <ul>
        <li>the required font is Comic Sans MS.</li>
        <li>all titles must be generated using WordArt, with at least a two-color gradient and 3d or shadow effects.</li>
      </ul>
    <li>All requirements must be of tweetable length.</li>
  </ol>
  <br/>
  <h2>Requirement Standards</h2>
  <p>
  The requirements document will be in a list.  The list will have sections to keep related requirements together.<br/>
  Each requirement shall have a label that can be linked to from other documents (e.g. the test document).<br/>
  Each requirement shall start with "The &lt;item&gt; shall", (e.g. "The system shall").<br/>
  If a requirement is related to any other requirements, a note with links to those requirements needs to be placed at the end of that requirement.<br/>
  Each requirement shall be small and concise to reduce complexity.
  <br/>
  See an example below:
  </p>
  <p>
  <h3><a name="Reqs">Requirements</a></h3>
  <h4><a name="GenReqs">General Requirements</a></h4>
  <a name="R1.0">R1.0 - The system shall be able to create a slice of toast, supposedly from a piece of bread.</a><br/>
  <a name="R1.9">R1.9 - The system shall heat a slice of bread to a such a significant degree that becomes toasted.</a><br/>
  <a name="R2.0">R2.0 - The system shall be able to create slices of toast that are consumable by humans.</a><br/>
  <a name="R3.0">R3.0 - The system shall use coils to heat the bread to create toast.</a><br/>
  <a name="R3.8">R3.8 - The system shall be able to heat each coil between 150 and 200 degrees Fahrenheit.</a><br/>
  <h4><a name="IOReqs">Input/Output Requirements</a></h4>
  <a name="IO1.0">IO1.0 - The system shall be able to consume a slice of bread as input.</a><br/>
  <a name="IO2.0">IO2.0 - The system shall be able to produce a slice of toast as output, given that a piece of bread has been given as input.  (See <a href="#IO1.0">IO1.0</a>)</a><br/>
  <a name="IO3.0">IO3.0 - The system shall have a main power switch that turns the toaster on.</a><br/>
  <a name="IO4.0">IO4.0 - The system shall have an activation lever on its anterior side, which when pressed will cause the system to consume a piece of bread if in the input slot.  (See <a href="#IO1.0">IO1.0</a>)</a><br/>
  <h4><a name="SafeReqs">Safety Requirements</a></h4>
  <a name="S1.0">S1.0 - The system shall be completely unsafe, considering the heat generated from the coils.  (See <a href="#R3.0">R3.0</a> and <a href="#R3.8">R3.8</a>)</a><br/>
  </p>
  <br/>
  <h2>Test Document Standards</h2>
  <p>
    The tests in the test document shall be in a table
    To avoid the overhead of writing out class names for each element, the table is instead constructed with an implicit schema based on the number of the column content is placed in. This implicit schema is then denoted in the table tag. The current schema is denoted with class="test-table-schema-1".
  </p><p>
  "test-table-schema-1" is organised in the following way.
  The table shall have five columns, in the following order: step number, directions, test, passed/failed, and related requirements.
  The step number column shall contain a unique identifier for the test step.
  Related steps shall be grouped together using whole numbers seperated by a decimal. Thus step 1.11 comes <em>after</em> step 1.1.
  The directions shall be sentences which describe the necessary procedures to execute before the test column is evaluated.
  The passed/failed column is currently unused but may contain content in the future.
  The related requirements column should hyperlink to the requirements that the test step satisfies.
